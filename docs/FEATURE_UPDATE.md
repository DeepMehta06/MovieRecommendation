## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Data Processing:**
```python
# Merged two datasets
movies_data (TMDB movies) + credits_data (TMDB credits)
    ↓
Extracted directors from JSON crew data
    ↓
Added: director, release_date, rating, overview
    ↓
Result: Complete movie information in recommendations
```

### **Director Extraction:**
- Parses JSON crew data from `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`
- Filters for crew members with job = "Director"
- Handles missing data gracefully (shows "N/A")

Each recommendation card now includes:
1. **Title + Year** - e.g., "Avatar (2009)"
2. **Director** - e.g., "🎬 Director: James Cameron"
3. **Release Date** - e.g., "📅 Release Date: 2009-12-10"
4. **Rating** - e.g., "⭐ Rating: 7.2/10"
5. **Overview** - Short plot description (truncated at 150 chars)
